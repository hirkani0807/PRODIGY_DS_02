📊 Task-02 — Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains Task-02 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
The objective of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice.
I explored relationships between variables, identified trends, and extracted meaningful insights from the data.

🔍 Task Overview

The main aim of this task is to understand how to prepare raw data for analysis and how to explore a dataset using visual and statistical methods.

✔ Key Objectives

Load and inspect the dataset

Clean the data (handle missing values, duplicates, incorrect types, etc.)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships and patterns

Interpret insights from the dataset

📁 Sample Dataset

You can use any dataset of your choice.
A sample dataset provided by Prodigy InfoTech can be found here:

🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning

In this task, the following cleaning steps were performed:

Checking dataset shape and structure

Handling missing values (dropna, fillna)

Removing duplicates

Converting data types (e.g., string → numeric)

Treating outliers (if required)

Renaming inconsistent column names

Data cleaning ensures the dataset becomes reliable and ready for proper analysis.

📊 Step 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps discover:

What the data contains

How variables behave

What patterns exist

How different features are related

✔ Types of Analysis Performed

Univariate Analysis:

Distribution of one variable

Histograms, bar charts, count plots

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:

Relationship between two or more variables

Scatter plots, heatmaps, correlation matrix

✔ Visualizations Used

Bar Charts

Histograms

Box Plots

Scatter Plots

Heatmaps

Pie Charts (optional)

📈 Example Insights

(Some examples—actual insights may differ based on chosen dataset)

Age distribution shows majority between 20–40 years

Gender distribution is imbalanced

Survival rate is higher in females (for Titanic dataset)

Fare increases with passenger class

Strong correlation found between Pclass and Fare
